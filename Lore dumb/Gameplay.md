    Each day should be somewhat quick
    Based on your sleep and other factors (random + some player influence) you get how hard games (speeded up + more notes)
    Doing bad in rhythm games will lower a random stat
    The game can  go on indefinitely, however, each day increases the difficulty of surviving through:
    Doing bad in rhythm games that get harder as time goes on
    RNG is bad and slowly stacking up

Relationship system

    When you meet up with a character you can hang out and trigger an event
    If you don't hang out with anyone you can also try and meet new people
    You can also just skip hanging out with people
    hanging out with people slowly makes you closer.
    Being closer unlocks new events
    Some characters bond closer with some characters

Event system

    Events either triggered by you by choice or are a random occurrence
    Events include some dialog and some choices to make
    danger zone events (mostly back end)
    Danger zone events are rare and are mostly based on several choices you made
    The player never will know that they are in danger
    When a dangerous event it may have smaller sub-events
