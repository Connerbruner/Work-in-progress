    Members are called creatures
    If you want to describe someone with Unnatural features you say they have features or less commonly people call themselves features
    Most members are in queer relationships
    piercings and jewelery
    Friendship bracelets
    Often more radical members have odder piercings
    Creatures with features often struggle to get jobs
    Often they are forced to do "dirty work".

Dirty work:

    Mostly intelligence gathering drug trafficking and bounty hunting.
    Often its just one depending on your skills
    Very "dont ask dont tell". Often you are given a "cover job"
    Can pay well but its far from safe
    EVERYONE in dirty work is punk

Punk

    Darker colors
    more radical
    Often custom clothes modified to be more ergonomic or sometimes fashionable
